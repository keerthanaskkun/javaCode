# Four Sum Problem - Java

This is a Java program I wrote to solve the Four Sum problem.  
The goal is to find all unique quadruplets in an array that add up to a given target.

## What it does
- Takes an integer array and a target value as input
- Uses sorting and a two-pointer method to find matching sets of 4 numbers
- Handles negative numbers and avoids duplicate results

## How to run
1. Save the file as `FourSum.java`
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   javac FourSum.java
   java FourSum
